# Protocol

* Use Github for project management, code, and outward facing documentation (e.g. html maps, instructions, results, etc.). Folder structure should be: 
	* code - all code in python or R
	* docs - results, documentation, writings, etc.
	* data - small data files for public use (each file has to be under 100mb)
	* maps - html map files
	* .asset - images and other repo specific content

* Use Google Drive for large data storage, meeting notes, and pre-release shared documents.
